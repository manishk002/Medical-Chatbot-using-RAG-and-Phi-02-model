## Overview

Access to reliable medical information is crucial for public health. This project uses state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques to create a chatbot capable of understanding and responding to medical queries with high accuracy. By combining RAG with the Phi-02 model, the chatbot can provide up-to-date and context-aware information to users.

## Features

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for improved accuracy and relevance
- Powered by the Phi-02 language model for advanced natural language understanding
- Integration with curated medical knowledge bases
- Real-time response generation
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction
- Privacy-focused design to protect sensitive medical queries

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/medical-chatbot-rag-phi02.git
   cd medical-chatbot-rag-phi02
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the pre-trained Phi-02 model and place it in the `models` directory.

4. Set up the knowledge base for RAG (instructions in `knowledge_base_setup.md`).

## Usage

Run the main script to start the Medical Chatbot:

```
python main.py
```

The chatbot will initialize and prompt you for input. Type your medical query and press Enter. The chatbot will process your query and provide a response.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main script for running the Medical Chatbot
- `rag_engine.py`: Implementation of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation system
- `model_interface.py`: Interface for the Phi-02 model
- `knowledge_base.py`: Functions for managing and querying the medical knowledge base
- `models/`: Directory containing the Phi-02 model
- `data/`: Directory for storing knowledge base data and other resources

## Model Training

This project uses the pre-trained Phi-02 model. If you want to fine-tune the model on specific medical data:

1. Prepare your medical dataset (not included in this repository)
2. Modify `finetune.py` to suit your data format and training objectives
3. Run the fine-tuning script:
   ```
   python finetune.py
   ```

Note: Fine-tuning requires significant computational resources and a large, high-quality medical dataset.
